## Bio

I currently serve the Clinical Pharmacy team of Providence Swedish Medical Center in the Puget Sound area.

I also teach quantitative data analysis to doctoral candidates as a Adjunct Instructor for the College of Education at Gonzaga University.

On the side I conduct my own research projects. I have abiding research interests in measurement validity, the sociology of religion, and political sociology. I also study theology and spirituality.

On this site I keep a list of [my publications](https://www.mm218.dev/papers), [presentations](https://www.mm218.dev/talks), and [my CV](https://www.mm218.dev/cv.pdf).
